# Docker overview

- Docker体系结构
    - Client <--> Daemon <--> Registry Server
    - The Docker Client
        - The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users **interact** with Docker.
        - The docker command uses the Docker API.
    - The Docker Daemon
        - The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as:
            - images
            - containers
            - networks
            - volumes(外部的持久存储)
    - Docker Registries
        - A Docker registry stores Docker images.
        - **Docker Hub** and **Docker Cloud** are public registries that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default.
        - You can even run your own private registry.

- Docker逻辑组件
    - Containers: 容器
    - Images: 镜像
    - Registry: Image Repositories

- When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects.
    - IMAGES
        - An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.
        - Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization.
        - You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry.
    - CONTAINERS
        - A container is a runnable instance of an image.
        - You can create, run, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.
        - You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.
