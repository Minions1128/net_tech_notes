- Docker provides three flags on the docker run and docker create commands for managing three different types of resource allowances that you can set on a container
    - memory
        - -m or --memory: bytes, Memory limit
    - CPU
        - -c, --cpu-shares: int, CPU shares (relative weight)
        - --cpuset-cpus: string, CPUs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1)
    - devices
        - --device: list, Add a host device to the container

- Docker creates a unique IPC namespace for each container by default
    - IPC
        - --ipc: string, IPC mode to use

- Running a container with full privileges
    - In those cases when you need to run a system administration task inside a container, you can grant that container privileged access to your computer
    - Privileged containers maintain their file system and network isolation but have full access to shared memory and devices and possess full system capabilities
        - --privileged: Give extended privileges to this container

- 测试工具: stress
